Posting Status feature is a small implementation of JQuery, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS concepts. This is a Facebook or Twitter like Status Posting or Updating feature. Here enter the text you want to post and notice that the counter starts decrementing as you type the content in the Text Space provided. Once you click on Post button provided, the content in the status text are is removed and is posed on the wall, meanwhile the counter is also reseted to the maximum size. Post button is enabled only if there is atleast 1 character to be displayed or if it doesnot exceed the maximum limit of the text size which is 140 in my web page. Enjoy Updating and posting your status.
