MakeURpizza is a small implementation of JS, HTML and CSS and concepts. Here I have creted few web pages which leads to customise your pizza and finaly using the google charts feature, I have displayed how the pizza looks like with what percentage of each topping on it. As this is one of my class asignments to do, I implemented it according to the requirements of the professor. So, this is less of javascript work but more of html and google chart work. Enjoy your Pizza.
